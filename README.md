![Aoyuki](/public/assets/repo/aoyuki-demo.png "Aoyuki")


Aoyuki is a static blog template in Astro, forked from Fuwari and Yukina, optimized for Github Pages and other static hosters.

## Installation

In a new repo, run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wlft/aoyuki.git aoyuki
```

Then, remove the `.git` folder manually or by running `rm -rf .git` to remove the history. After that, you can either run `git init` or use any other version manager as usual, or none!

## Running

1. [Install NodeJS v24 or above](https://nodejs.org/en), if not already installed
2. Enable pnpm:
   - `corepack enable`
   - `corepack enable pnpm`
3. Run `pnpm install`
4. Run either `pnpm run build` or `pnpm run dev` to host Aoyuki on your local machine.
